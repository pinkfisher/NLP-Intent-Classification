# NLP Intent Classification using pre-trained BERT
## This repository contains notebooks used for the final Scalable Machine Learning project, Fall 2019 at UT, Austin.
###### The works in this repo are based on Transfer Learning of pre-trained BERT Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.

- data_pre_processing.ipynb - Note book for extracting banking domain related intents from the dataset used in this paper [An Evaluation Dataset for Intent Classification and Out-of-Scope Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02027.pdf).
- Banking_Intent_classification_simple_transformer.ipynb - Multiclass Intent classifier using pre-trained BERT. This is built for the banking intent classification chatbot application for our project based on simpletransformers and huggingface transformers pytorch library
- BERT_TF_Intent_Classification.ipynb - Tensorflow version of the Multiclass Intent classifier using pre-trained BERT
